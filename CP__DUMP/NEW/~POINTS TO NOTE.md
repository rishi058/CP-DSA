2. Understand it through Given Test Cases.

3. If constraints are not given then ask for constraint :-  `MAY I KNOW ABOUT THE CONSTRAINTS FOR THE INPUTS"`.

4. If you are not getting anywhere near solution. `JUST BRUTE FORCE THE SOLUTION.`

5. Take your time(think in mind, HOW will you explain the solution to your interviewer)
6. If every thing is clear Begin to Explain to interviewer.

#### NOTE : Use meaningful variables.

#### TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY :

1. Give a example of large i/p which will help in Imagining the WORST Complexity.

#### IMP POINTS

If you need 10 seconds to think during an interview, respond confidently and politely. Here's what you can say:

"That's a great question. Let me take a moment to think about it."

"Iâ€™d like to gather my thoughts to provide the best answer. Just a moment, please."

"Let me take a second to organize my thoughts for a clear response."
