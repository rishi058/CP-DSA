### Basic System Design Principles (Q1 - Q10)

1. **What is System Design?**
   - **Definition**: System design is a structured approach to creating or planning the architecture of a system to achieve specific goals, focusing on components, data flow, and interactions.
   - **Goals**:
     - Ensure scalability, reliability, and efficiency.
     - Balance functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security).
   - **Approach**: Break down requirements, define each component’s role, and map out data flow.
   - **Example**: Designing an e-commerce system includes product catalogs, payment processing, user accounts, and order management.

2. **Explain Monolithic vs. Microservices Architectures.**
   - **Monolithic**:
     - A single codebase with tightly integrated components.
     - Suitable for small projects due to ease of deployment.
     - Challenges: Limited scalability, difficult to maintain for large systems.
   - **Microservices**:
     - Breaks down applications into smaller, loosely coupled services.
     - Pros: Independent scaling, easier debugging, flexible technology choices.
     - Cons: More complex deployment and inter-service communication.

3. **What is Load Balancing, and why is it important?**
   - **Definition**: Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Prevents overload on single servers, increasing reliability and speed.
     - Enhances availability and fault tolerance.
   - **Types**:
     - Round-robin, least connections, IP hashing.
   - **Examples**: Used in high-traffic applications like social media or e-commerce to ensure user requests are handled smoothly.

4. **What is Scalability?**
   - **Definition**: Ability of a system to grow in capacity to handle increasing demand.
   - **Types**:
     - Vertical scaling: Adding more resources to existing servers.
     - Horizontal scaling: Adding more servers to a system.
   - **Example**: Expanding server capacity for an app during peak times, like Black Friday for e-commerce.

5. **Define Latency and Throughput.**
   - **Latency**:
     - Delay before a data transfer begins.
     - Lower latency is crucial for real-time systems (e.g., gaming).
   - **Throughput**:
     - Amount of data processed in a given timeframe.
     - High throughput is important for batch processing systems, like video streaming.
   - **Trade-off**: Optimizing one can impact the other.

6. **How does Caching improve system performance?**
   - **Caching**:
     - Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce retrieval time.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Improves speed, reduces database load, and handles repeated requests efficiently.

     - In-memory caching (Redis, Memcached), browser caching.
   - **Example**: Caching user profiles to prevent repeated database queries on each visit.

7. **What is CAP Theorem?**
   - **Theory**: Distributed systems can achieve only two of the three properties:
     - Consistency (same data across nodes).
     - Availability (system remains operational).
     - Partition tolerance (functions despite network splits).
   - **Example**: NoSQL databases often choose availability and partition tolerance.

8. **Explain Consistency in distributed systems.**
   - **Definition**: Ensures all nodes reflect the same data state at any time.
   - **Importance**:
     - Prevents conflicts, especially in systems requiring real-time data accuracy (e.g., banking).
   - **Types**:
     - Strong consistency, eventual consistency (as seen in Amazon DynamoDB).
   - **Example**: In e-commerce, inventory data must remain consistent to prevent overselling.

9. **What is Partition Tolerance?**
   - **Definition**: System’s resilience to network partitions, allowing operations even when nodes are isolated.
   - **Importance**:
     - Enables fault tolerance, essential for distributed systems.
   - **Example**: In a global system, partition tolerance ensures each region remains active despite temporary connectivity issues.

10. **What is Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling?**
    - **Horizontal Scaling**:
      - Adding more servers to distribute the load.
      - Used in cloud-based systems for distributed load handling.
    - **Vertical Scaling**:
      - Enhancing a single server’s capacity (e.g., CPU, memory).
      - Simpler but has physical limits.
    - **Example**: Horizontal scaling is used by social media platforms to manage global user bases.
