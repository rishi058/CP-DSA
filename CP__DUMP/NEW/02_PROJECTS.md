#### => RECURSION VISUALISER

This tool allows us to generate recursion tree for any custom made C++ recursion function.
It helps programmers to understand Recursion in a better way & increase their problems solving skill. Generally Recursion & DP based problems.

It is made using NextJS, TypeScript & TailWind CSS.
I've used Axios for API fetching, CodeMirror for Integrated IDE, JUDGE CE API for compiling code and REACT-FLOW for tree-visualisation.

NOW LET ME TELL YOU HOW IT'S WORK :-

1. The C++ function stores the information about the recursion tree in a adjacency list
   after the execution of recursion function.

2. Reingold-Tilford Tree Drawing Algorithm is used to assign coordinates to each node of the tree, so the nodes deosn't overlap.
   This is the most complicated part of the project from my view. As it took me hours of researching & implementations to finally 
   complete this part.

3. This tree data is used by react-flow library to plot the tree.

#### => RADIO PLAYER APP

1. This radio app features an open source Radio Api enabling it to provide upto 45000+ radio channels across worldwide. This app is currently published it on playstore.

1.5> get top-voted channels, top countries, search based on tags like [channel_names, countries, genre, language], add channels to your fav-list.

2. While building it, I focused on creating a smooth and intuitive UI by integrating Hero Animations for transitions and a Carousel Slider for easy horizontal navigation.

3. I've also used Pagination to improve performance & allowing users to browse channels seamlessly.

4. I've used Firebase for managing secure Google sign-ins.

5. It focuses on modular directory structure which ensures scalability.

6. This appâ€™s responsive design adapts seamlessly across multiple devices.

7. Using OOP and dependency injection, I've created an optimized, maintainable codebase prepared for future updates.

#### => DISCUSSIFY CHAT APPLICATION 

1. This is a real-time web based chat-appication. One of my FULL-STACK-WEB-DEVELOPMENT-PROJECT.

2. It's frontend is made using Vite, React, TypeScript, TailWind CSS & Daisy UI. I've used Axios for API Handling on the frontend side.

3. It's backend is made using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB. It feature JWT Authentication.

*************

1. I have also implemented a logger in the backend. Which Logs all api-calls along with is details like STATUS_CODE | TYPE OF API CALL | END_POINT | RESPONSE_TIME 
| RES_BODY | REQ_BODY.

2. This feature is comes in handy while developing the application as it's helps to make debugging process more effecient. 

3 I've implemented 2 major features using web-sockets.
a. SHOW ONLINE STATUS of each user who are currently active on the appication.
B. Realtime auto message update. Here user will not have to refresh the page to view new messages.

*************

1. This projects focuses on modular directory structure which ensures scalability and maintainable codebase prepared for future updates.

2. The user-interface of this web-site offers DARK and LIGHT MODE with a beautiful animated theme switching.

3. It has a responsive UI which helps to adapts seamlessly across multiple devices.

#### => NOTES APP 

1. One of my initial Project, when i was on my learning curve & exploring diffrent tech-stacks.

2. It's features CRUD functionality.

3. It's backend & frontend both are written in Dart programming language.

4. This project uses Firestore database which is based on NoSQL.

5. It has Google-O-Auth implemented for login purposes.

6. All the notes are stored in the firestore database so that you can access it from any android phone using your login credentials.
