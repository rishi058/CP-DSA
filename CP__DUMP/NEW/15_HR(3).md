# Teamwork and Conflict

**1. Two of your team members have conflicting approaches to solving a problem, and both believe their method is superior. How would you decide which is the best course of action?**  

Organize a neutral discussion where both members present their approaches with data and reasoning. If possible, I'd suggest combining the strengths of both solutions to satisfy both parties.

Moving forward, I'd document my contributions more clearly and ensure they're communicated to the team. If the issue continues, I'd discuss it with my manager, presenting evidence of my work.

If this will not work, I can try to be friends with him/her by making some conversations(not related to work) and sharing break time.

If they remain unresponsive, I'd discuss this matter to my manager for guidance while continuing to make progress on the project.
