KNAP-SACK - CONCEPT :--
1. Various problems.
2. 0/1 Knapsack
3. Fractional Knapsack  ---      (Greedy Problem)
4. Rod Cutting          ---      (Unbound Knapsack)
5. Subset Sum

********************************************************
0/1 Knapsack -- Example -->

[ 0 & 1 stands for take it or not take it]
A theif goes to a museum for stealing he has a bag which can hold a capacity of 10kg only..
there are 5 antiques. ->
wt    :-  2 ,  3,  6 , 5 , 4
price :-  12, 11, 15, 19, 15
Find the maximun profit he can make..
 
*********************************************************
Fractional Knapsack -->

In above problem we can't take fractions of antiques..
but if a Sand Bag or something else Fractionable is there we can use this approach..

*********************************************************

Unbound Knapsack  -->

A Rod of lenght is 8m.
partial length :-  1  2  3  5  7
price          :-  3  4  2  6  8
in which way Rod should be cut and sold to obtain max profit..
Here , we can repeat partial length unlike in 0/1 knapsack --> (there we can't steal a single antique twice..)
