    Graph representation -->
    1. Matrix
    2. List --> Array of Vectors, Vector of Vectors  (commons)

    Traversal --> (algorithm+Approach)
    1. DFS  (Depth First Search)
    2. BFS  (Breadth First Search)
    These are the most common algo used in graph and trees.

    Imp. Algo-->
    1. Djikstra.
    2. Bellman-Ford.
    ****************Extra's************
    3. Disjoint Set Union.
    4. Minimum Spanning Tree.
    5. Directed Acyclic Graph.
    6. Topological Sort

    Graph Terminologies -->  (graph is also known as forest)

    Acyclic Graph -->  a directed Graph where cycle appears but dont have actual cycle bcz dir. of edges dont form cycles.
    Cyclic Graph  -->  a graph containing cycle.
    Trees         -->  graph which dont have any cycles. 

    1. Vertices(v) And Edges(e)   {v = no. of elements} {e = no. of lines}  (e = v-1 , in trees)
    2. Undirected and Directed Graphs.
    3. Connected Components.   (group of components connected with edges)
    4. Strongly Connected Components. 
    5. Height And Depth in a tree. (no. of edges in b/w)  (height of a vertex in dist of it from bottom-most vertex) (depth of vertex is dist of it from its root)
    6. Root/Child/Parent/ Leaf Nodes in a Tree(i.e last node)

    4. strongly connented components.(in directed graphs)
    if 3 comp. a,b,c such that we can go a-->b-->c || b-->a-->c || etc, all comb.
    then these 3 are 1 strongly connected component. e.g-->a,b,c are in cycle
    a single comp. is 1 strongly conn. cmp. if its neighbour are useless.

    7.LCA (first common parent).
