/*

in adjacency matrix method , it is easy to find whether 2 vertices is conn. or not
or what is weight of edge b/w them -->   by accessing graph[i][j] directly..  O(1)_

in list it is not possible--> we have to use loop-->

for(int chilld : graph[i]){
    if(child==j){
        cout<<"connected ";
    }
}

or

for( pair <int,int> chilld : graph[i] ){
    if(child.first==j){
        cout<<"connected ";
        cout<<"weight : "<<child.second ;
    }
}
