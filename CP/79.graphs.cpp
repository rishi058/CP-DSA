/*********GRAPH REPRESENTATION*************
1. Adjency method
2. list - array of vectors   (most common)

In adjency(i.e matrix method):-
--> we have to make a matrix of rows/columns equal or greater than constraints of magnitude(i.e value of vertices);
--> in this, -ve value can't be used as a magnitude, bcz rows/column depict values..
--> element of the matrix depict weight of edges (0 if no edge exists)

--> it is suitable for both directed and undirected graph

--> Generally input is given by :-  (eg of undirected with cycle graph :-)
6 9      // n,m  = no. of vertices, edges__;
1 3     // connecting components given __
1 5    //weights if given :-
3 5   6
3 5   4
3 4   3
3 6
3 2
2 6
4 6
