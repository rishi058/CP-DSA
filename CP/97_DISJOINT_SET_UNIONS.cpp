/*
DSU is user-defined data structure..
It is used to make group of trees..

It has 3 function..
1. Make     -->     it is used to make a independent node..
2. find     -->     it gives you the root of a node -- (parent of the group) -- (topmost element)
3. Union    -->     it is used to form union i.e join(a,b) = group containg node a 
                    nd another group cantaining node b join's together to form 1 group.


the tree formed using DSU is directed towards parent of the group..
this tree have some diffrent properties w.r.t to normal tree..

it is a simpler than dfs, so some question's of dfs can also be solved using DSU.
but questions having a properties like DSU trees will only be solved by DSU..

find the no. of connected components --> (can be solved by both DSU & DFS)
find presense of a cycle -->  (can be solved by both DSU & DFS)

NOTE :-  
1. find func is diff from LCA of DFS..
2. Union(a,b) ->   if no. of nodes of parent of a == no. of nodes of parent of b.
                   then compare a,b. if a<b then overall parent after union is parent of a.

                   if no. of nodes of parent of a < no. of nodes of parent of b.
                   then overall parent after union is parent of b 

3. Types of union ->
     a.)   weighted union / union by size (mention above)
     b.)   union by size.
