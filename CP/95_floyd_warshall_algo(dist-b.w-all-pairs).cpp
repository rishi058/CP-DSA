/*
DIRECTED GRAPH -->

Dijkstra algo is used when 1 source is there....

for obtaining shortest path b/w all pairs of vertices..where edges have diff wt's...
this algo is used..

this algo also handles -ve weights of edges..
but not handles cycle with net -ve weights..

CONCEPT :-
let k = 1, 2, 3 ... utpo n  -->  (n = no. of vertices)
now we store each pair's info(i.e dist) in a nXn  matrix where -> the indices(i.e row nd col. no.) of matrix denotes pairs...
first we give all value of matrix = inf; nd then give the dist - 0 to pairs of same verices(i.e 1,1 - 2,2 - 3,3...etc) 

in this algo we take a pair at a time and find dist b/w them through every other nodes and finally store its min value...
let there be a pair of vertices i,j intially the dist b/w i and j vertex is the value of dist[i][j]..
we go through every other vertices k(k=1,2,3..) and calclulate dist through it..by dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]...
let i=1, j=4  if intially dist b/w 1 nd 4 is 55..now when we go from 1 to 2 (dist b/w is 11) nd from 2 to 4(dist b/w them is 15) so new shorter dist is 26...
