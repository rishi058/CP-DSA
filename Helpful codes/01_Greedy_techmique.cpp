/*
Greedy is the name of technique it isn't a algorithm.

Selection of Best solution among all solutions..

Some Greedy problems can also be solved using Dynamic Programming ..

In Most of Greedy problems we have to find the Max or Min type answers..

It is also called as optimized technique.
STEPS :-
Selection  ->   feasible solutions  -> optimized solution .

Generally solved in O(N) time ..
