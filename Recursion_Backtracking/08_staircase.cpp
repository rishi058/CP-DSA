you are standing at the bottom-ground, in-front of u there are n staircase.
you have to go to the nth staircase. at a time you can climb 1 or 2 or 3 stairs.
Find the no. of ways in which you can go to the nth staircase.

E.g   -->   4-staircase,   Soln :-
{1,1,1,1} {1,1,2} {2,1,1} {1,2,1} {1,3} {3,1} {2,2} --> 7 is ans.

HINT :-
think that you are at top and descending down the stairs...
3 ways to descend...;
